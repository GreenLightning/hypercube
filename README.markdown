## Project Structure

The main source code is located in the **src** folder. Currently used libraries are in **lib** and everything in this folder should be on the classpath. The sources and other data belonging to the libraries are in **_lib** (note the underscore), but this folder should *not* be on the classpath.

The source code of the example programs is in **example** and the PDFs generated by those programs in **examples**.

The **javadoc** file contains command line options for the *javadoc* tool. It is configured to save output to the **apidocs** folder (however, git is configured to ignore this folder). To generate the documentation just execute the following command in the root directory of this repository:

    javadoc @javadoc

This repository is a working Eclipse project including a **.project** and a **.classpath** file. Additionally, there are two JAR descriptions for Eclipse's JAR Export Wizard in the **eclipse** folder, which can be used to generate binary and source JAR files for releases.
